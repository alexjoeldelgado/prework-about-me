        <h1><center>Who is Postmodern Jukebox?</center></h1>
        <p>Scott Bradlee's Postmodern Jukebox is an Music Cover Band, specializing in taking Top 40 Hits and rearranging the music and tone to that of a specific decade, such as the 1920's or 1950's. With a rotating cast of musicians, PMJ has amassed over 1.2 billion Youtube views and 4 million subscribers.
            <p></p>
            They were started by Scott Bradlee from New York, New York in 2011. They do release a new video each week on their Youtube Channel, which helps to keep their subscribers entertained. 
            <p></p>
            As their popularity grew, PMJ was able to arrange its first musical tour in 2016, notably opening for the Dubai International Jass Festival, alongside Sting, Toto, Chris Botti, and David Gray. This marked the beginning of a 75-Day European tour, a 16-City Australian Tour, and a 45-Stop North American Tour. 
            <p></p>
            Since then, they have continued success in Jazz coverings, due to their consistent uploads and remarkable talent.
